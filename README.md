In this application you can search for GitHub users to view their public information. To accomplish this, use the GitHub API to fetch users by name and display the information the response provides. In addition, there are more features, for example, each of the users you searched for is saved in a history, and that same history can be deleted. The functionalities were made possible thanks to the useReducer Hook, which, depending on the type of action received, will be in charge of performing different actions. Finally, for the API call, use react-query, a powerful library that simplifies our lives thanks to its various advantages.
